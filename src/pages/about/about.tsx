      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        Born in Germany, I moved around a fair bit as a kid, eventually settling
        in the suburbs of London. I've now lived in various parts of the capital
        for the past 15 years, making me the most English sounding Scot you'll
        ever encounter - though when rugby's on, there's no doubt of my origins!{" "}

        I started learning to code in 2018 inspired by conversations with
        candidates throughout my career in technical recruitment. During a stint
        at ThirdEye Labs as their talent acquisition manager, they offered me
        the chance to be an engineer part time. After loving this experience, I
        attended Kodiri to firm up on my MERN stack skills.

        I've since spent some time working for a FinTech startup, before moving
        onto my current role at M2A Media, where I work on cloud-based video
        solutions for multiple high profile clients!

        When I'm not working, you can find me playing ice hockey or rugby,
        learning the latest javascript framework, or going on holiday to
        somewhere with interesting animals!
